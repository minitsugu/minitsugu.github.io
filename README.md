## The Minimalist IT Survival Guide
_For reasonable people and alike._

--- work in progress ---

This is a collection of tips for computer workers who need decent cross-platform tools.

---

The **most useful shell command** is `cd -` (change to previous directory).

---

**Windows is Windows**. It's not Posix compliant. Accept it.

---

**CMD.exe** does not behave like a real terminal or Unix shell, has no globbing (shell expansion) and quoting is a nightmare.\
If you're serious about Windows scripting, learn **Powershell** immediately.

However, **CMD.exe** is always available and has a low startup time.\
The **Batch files** are double-clickable, familiar to many non-programmers and therefore an effective mechanism to distribute code.\
It's also the best solution to mimic shell aliases (and make CMD.exe tolerable).

For deduplicated, locally encrypted, **remote backup** check [BorgBackup](https://www.borgbackup.org/).

---

[Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) is a modern, **cross-platform shell** that looks promising.

Robin Bowes [flac2mp3](https://github.com/robinbowes/flac2mp3) script is the best around for collection of files. Defaults to VBR v2, just needs `perl`, `flac` and `lame`.
