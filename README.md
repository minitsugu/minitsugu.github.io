## The Minimalist IT Survival Guide
_For reasonable people and alike._

This is a collection of tips for computer workers who need decent cross-platform tools.

### Collections of unix tools ###

[Busybox](https://www.busybox.net) _aims to be the smallest and simplest correct implementation of the_ ___standard Linux command line tools___, packaged as a single executable.
With millions of installed copies, it's a proven and mature solution, unless you need special command line options. A subset has been ported to **Windows** as [busybox-w32](https://frippery.org/busybox) (500KB), which is also actively maintained and regularly synchronised with upstream. As a bonus, the **Almquist shell** (ash) is included.

[uutils](https://uutils.github.io) _aims to be a drop-in replacement for the_ ___GNU utils___, but modernized, reimplemented in Rust and working on _as many platforms as possible_. 

[PerlPowerTools](https://perlpowertools.com) (1MB, only the scripts) - **BSD utilities** written in pure Perl.

### Alternatives for Windows (only) ###

[UnxUtils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnxUtils) (6MB) ports of many **GNU utilities**, built as standalone executables (unmaintained since 2003).

If you just want to run **Bash on Windows** (now!), then installs [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org) (380MB). It comes with **Git Bash**, over 200 utilities, vim and perl.

---

The **most useful shell command** is `cd -` (change to previous directory).

---

**Windows is Windows**. It's not Posix compliant. Accept it.

---

**CMD.exe** does not behave like a real terminal or Unix shell, has no globbing (shell expansion) and quoting is a nightmare.\
If you're serious about Windows scripting, learn **Powershell** immediately.

However, **CMD.exe** is always available and has a low startup time.\
The **Batch files** are double-clickable, familiar to many non-programmers and therefore an effective mechanism to distribute code.\
It's also the best solution to mimic shell aliases (and make CMD.exe tolerable).

---

For deduplicated, locally encrypted, **remote backup** check [BorgBackup](https://www.borgbackup.org/).

---

[Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) is a modern, **cross-platform shell** that looks promising.

Robin Bowes [flac2mp3](https://github.com/robinbowes/flac2mp3) script is the best around for collection of files. Defaults to VBR v2, just needs `perl`, `flac` and `lame`.
